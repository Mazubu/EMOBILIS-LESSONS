    Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.<br>
    Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph
    is half a page long, etc.<br>
    In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.<br>
    A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors
    116).<br>
    Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.<br>

For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence
long.<br>
Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.<br>
In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the
paragraph.<br>
